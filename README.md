The program is a coin toss game. It prompts the user if they want to play; if the answer is 'no' the game ends; if the answer is 'yes', the program asks the user to select heads or tails (0 for heads, 1 for tails). A random number is generated, if the number generated matches the number the user selected, the games ends with a congratulatory message. If not, the user is prompted again for heads or tails.
